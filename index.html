                Our goal is to provide current and former Columbia students with a virtual
                campus to reunite with classmates and professors. By working together as a community, users can help
                rebuild
                Columbia in all of its glory, block by block.

               <h3 class="bot"> Students have expressed how disconnected they feel from campus as seen in multiple posts on Facebook including memes about people not knowing how to study outside of Butler. They expressed wanting “comfort and motivation for those of us missing Columbia” even as we are separated by time zones and different life situations amidst COVID-19. 
               </h3>
               <h3 >
                In this way we are providing an opportunity for students to connect with each other “on campus” to combat these issues of loneliness and disconnectedness before the Fall through a fun interactive campus on Minecraft.
