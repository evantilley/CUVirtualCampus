                    <div>
                        Simple! We're planning on opening up the server on Tuesday
                        at 5pm and at that time we'll be releasing the ip address! <br>
                        From there you can connect to the server and check it out!

                    <div>
                        Yup! We're still working on the particular details right now,
                        but the ranking system will be something like this: <br>

                        The whole point of the server is Columbia students coming together to recreate campus when we can't be there! <br>
                        However, there are a lot of Columbia students and in order to keep the community building process relatively organized,
                        we're going to designate certain areas that students can build in from time to time. These are called <u>Student Projects</u> <br>
                         So, for instance, we might start a student project to build Lerner and, during that time, open up a pre-measured area that
                         students can build in.

                    <div>
                        We're going to create an application process soon! Builders are essential to the server as they can help build various
                        parts of campus, in addition to the current student project.

                        Great question! We have strict guidelines as to how the campus is recreated and we're using a 1:1 scale. Using Google
                        Earth, we measure the distance between various buildings. Let's say the distance between 2 buildings is 100 meters.
                        1 block = 1 meter, so we would then make the building 100 blocks. More information/guides on building will be released soon!
